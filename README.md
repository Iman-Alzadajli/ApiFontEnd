# 🛍️ X Shop - Fake Store API Viewer

## 📌 Overview

X Shop is a simple web application that fetches product data from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/products) and displays it in a clean, responsive layout using Bootstrap cards. This project was created to practice using REST APIs with `fetch`, `async/await`, and DOM manipulation in JavaScript.
